# KetoCare Monitor

<p align="center"><img src="./images/cover.png"/></p>

This project aims to provide support to doctors to monitor diabetes and prevent diabetic ketoacidosis.

Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires continuous and accurate monitoring of blood sugar levels. A potentially dangerous complication of diabetes, called ketoacidosis, occurs when the organism begins to produce excess ketones leading to an increase of the acidity level in the blood.
